const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // ... some database operation to fetch user data based on userId ...
  if (!userData) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  }

});

//Problem: The code does not handle potential errors during the database operation. If there's a database error, the server will likely crash or return a 500 Internal Server Error without any specific information about the cause.

//Uncommon aspect: While missing error handling is common, forgetting to handle errors specifically within asynchronous database operations in Express.js is often overlooked.  The error might not be immediately apparent depending on the error handling setup of the database driver or the overall application.
