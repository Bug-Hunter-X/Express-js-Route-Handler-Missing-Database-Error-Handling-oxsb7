# Express.js Route Handler Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Express.js applications: neglecting error handling within asynchronous database operations inside route handlers.  This can lead to server crashes or unhelpful error responses to clients.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles database errors gracefully.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the solution)

## Bug Explanation

The original code lacks a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors thrown by database interactions (e.g., connection failures, query errors). Without proper error handling, a database failure will cause the server to crash, providing no insightful information to the user or administrator. This is more problematic than other simple errors since it indicates the program cannot reliably connect to resources crucial to its intended functionality.

## Solution

The solution adds a `try...catch` block to the route handler, providing a more robust approach by properly handling database errors.
This makes the server more resilient to database issues and helps to provide users with more informative feedback, instead of crashing.
